Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Data in Production Lines

This project surveys techniques for anomaly detection in high-dimensional settings, with a focus on Principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction followed by clustering methods for anomaly detection.
In a dataset with a large number of features before removing the redundant data, it should be known that if a feature is really redundant and it is not important for gathering information from the data. PCA is an unsupervised learning method, which can be used when the data donâ€™t have a label or target for each observation in the dataset, and its objective is to look for patterns in the data. PCA performs linear transformations on the data to minimize the noise and redundant data. The result brings out a dataset only including the most important characteristics of the data.
Clustering is a widely used unsupervised pattern classification method that divides the input space into multiple regions based on a similarity or dissimilarity. It groups similar elements into the same cluster while separating dissimilar elements into different clusters. Data points that belong to small or sparse clusters, or that are far away from their assigned cluster, can be considered anomalies. K-means, DBSCAN, OPTICS and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering methods will be used in the production line dataset for this project.
